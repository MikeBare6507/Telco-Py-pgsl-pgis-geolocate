# Telco-Py-pgsl-pgis-geolocate
Geolocation scripts for baseline simulation models for Telco asset project
This set of scripts is for initial phase of a project to recreate a past project for which I did not own product and output. All aspects of the real project have been rendered anonymous and transformed so as to not violate any potential IP conflicts. The additional goal is to provide a baseline set of scripts that can be strung together for iterations to similate changes over time given some exogenous (e.g., weather, population changes, transportation development, urban development and zoning, macroeconomic, etc.) and endogenous (changes in business practices, strategic initiatives, etc.) inputs. Some of the GIS data has been gathered and/or manufactured (arbitrary drawing of geographic boundaries of hypothetical or simulated organization-specific "markets").
